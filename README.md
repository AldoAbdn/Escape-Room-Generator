# Escape Room Generator
This was my honours project for BsC(Hons) Computing: Application Software Development at Robert Gordon University, I have since graduated with first class honours

This is a web app for designing an escape room using drag and drop components, videos of the project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWRRwFEmEuDLqtRkq0rQVgbfJRQ7OqE53)
## Audience 
This web app is aimed at escape room designers of all levels  

There will be a focus on ease of use for users such as teachers, as the web app could be used to design escape rooms for a classroom
## Key Features of the App 
- Allows the creation of escape room designs using a drag and drop interface 
- Allows the export of escape room designs in JSON or PDF format 
- All designs are tied to a user account and can be accessed by signing in 
- Allows accessibility options to be set for a room, that defines constraings that the room must adhere to
- Were possible, will auto generate puzzle solutions 
## Wireframe 
A simple wireframe of the design can be found [here](https://ninjamock.com/s/KCMW2Tx), this was the original wireframe submitted as part of the project and may not reflect the projects current state 
## Main Focuses of the Project 
There are 3 main focuses of the project: 
### Escape Room Design/Portability 
This web app has been designed to allow easy creation and exchange of escape room designs  

As far as I am aware there is no set standard for an escape room design, this project attempts to address this by defining escape room designs in JSON format   

The web app has been designed to be easy to use so that novice designers such as teachers could use the web app for purposes such as gamification of the classroom 
### Puzzle Generation 
Where possible the web app will attempt to generate solutions to puzzles within a design  

Various methods will be experimented with 
### Accessibility 
Escape rooms are becoming more and more popular however accessibility within the escape room industry has not been heavily researched   

I have incorporated accessibility options within the designer so that designers can specify the accessibility of their designs
